# Zack's Branch

The files in this branch are what Zack contributed.<br>
<br>
Several steps in the process were done in Excel and aren't apparent in the Python files. For example, the data from output_with_regions.csv was added to California_airbnb.csv in Excel. 

Data sources: 
- Airbnb data was collected from Kaggle. <br>
- SCAG Subregions data was collected from the Los Angeles County Enterprise GIS website. <br>
- Attractions data was compiled manually using information from Google Maps.
